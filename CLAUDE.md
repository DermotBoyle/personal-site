## Project

Personal portfolio site for Dermot — senior React Native/TypeScript developer, team lead, former music teacher turned software engineer, flamenco guitar student, based in Malaga, Spain.

This site should tell a story, not just list credentials. Dermot's career arc — from music education to leading mobile development at companies like Essent and adidas — is the narrative thread.

## Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for animations
- Google Fonts

## Aesthetic Direction: "Malaga Editorial"

A sophisticated editorial/magazine aesthetic infused with the warmth and light of southern Spain. Think Monocle magazine laid out on a terrace in Malaga — polished, confident, sun-soaked.

### Typography
- Display/headlines: A striking serif like **Playfair Display**, **DM Serif Display**, or **Cormorant Garamond** — elegant, editorial, with personality
- Body: A warm humanist sans like **Source Sans 3**, **Libre Franklin**, or **DM Sans** — readable, modern, never cold
- Generous sizing for headlines. Let typography breathe and command attention.

### Color Palette
Think golden hour in Malaga — warm terracotta, aged white walls, deep Mediterranean shadows.

- **Background**: Warm off-white/cream (`#FAF6F1` or similar) — never stark white
- **Text**: Deep warm charcoal (`#2C2825`) — never pure black
- **Accent primary**: Terracotta/burnt orange (`#C4572A` range) — the clay rooftops of Malaga
- **Accent secondary**: Deep Mediterranean blue (`#1B4965` range) — the sea at dusk
- **Subtle accent**: Warm sand/gold (`#D4A853` range) — afternoon light
- Use CSS variables for all colors. The palette should feel like it belongs to a place.

### Layout & Composition
- Editorial grid with intentional asymmetry — magazine-style columns that break when needed
- Generous whitespace (warm-space, really) — let content breathe like a well-designed spread
- Full-bleed sections mixed with contained, tight typographic sections
- Pull quotes, oversized numbers, and typographic details that feel like magazine design
- Overlap elements occasionally — text over subtle image backgrounds, layered sections

### Motion & Interaction
- Smooth, confident page-load animations — staggered reveals, not bouncy or playful
- Subtle parallax on key sections
- Hover states that feel tactile — underlines that draw, colors that shift warmly
- Scroll-triggered reveals that pace the reading experience like turning magazine pages
- Restraint is key: motion should feel like a warm breeze, not a carnival

### Texture & Atmosphere
- Subtle paper-like grain or noise texture on backgrounds — never flat digital white
- Soft warm shadows, nothing harsh
- Consider thin decorative lines, elegant dividers, editorial flourishes
- Photography (when added) should feel warm, natural-light, Mediterranean

### Tone
- Confident but approachable — not corporate, not casual
- First person where it makes sense
- Short, punchy copy alongside longer narrative sections
- Let the music and flamenco background add warmth and humanity, not gimmickry

## Content Sections

### Hero
- Name, tagline, and a compelling one-liner that captures the narrative
- Should feel like a magazine cover — bold, typographic, atmospheric
- Subtle warm background texture

### About / Story
- The career arc: music education → teaching → software engineering → tech leadership → Malaga
- Written like an editorial profile piece, not a LinkedIn summary
- This is the heart of the site

### Work & Experience
- Essent (current) — mobile app team lead, React Native, accessibility
- adidas — enterprise-scale applications
- Present as curated highlights, not an exhaustive CV
- Magazine-style layout: project cards or editorial spreads

### Side Projects
- Launch Sixty — 60-day cohort program for non-technical founders
- Tarot AI app
- Present with personality — these show range and ambition

### Music & Flamenco
- Background in music education, bachelor's in music
- Currently studying flamenco guitar in Malaga
- This section adds soul to the portfolio — treat it with the same design care as the tech sections

### Contact
- Clean, warm, inviting
- Links to GitHub, LinkedIn, email
- Consider a simple contact form

## Rules

- Never use generic portfolio layouts or template patterns
- Never use Inter, Roboto, Arial, or system fonts
- Never use purple gradients, blue-on-white SaaS aesthetics, or cold corporate palettes
- Never use placeholder text — write real copy that sounds like a human, not a resume
- Every section should feel intentionally designed, like a magazine spread
- Accessibility matters: maintain contrast ratios, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
- Mobile-first responsive design — the site should feel just as editorial on a phone
- All images are optional — the design should be stunning with pure typography and color alone
